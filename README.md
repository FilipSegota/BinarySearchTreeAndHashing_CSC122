**Assignment:**
Binary Search Tree and Hashing Lab 

## Overview
There are three components to this lab. Studying time to look up a student for an institution. Compare hashing, BST, and just sort with a binary search.

## Details
Can have up to 100,000 students. Each student has an unique id. For the sort, use the merge sort. For the binary search, may choose to implement it with iteration or recursion. Count the number of compares as building the structure and then as looking up students. Vary the number of lookups to 5% of the population, 50% of the population, 100% of the population, 1000% of the population. Vary the input based upon the order of the data (in order, random order, reverse order). May also vary number of students if you wish.

## Components
This lab is divided into two parts:  
  - **Part 1, Design:** For this part develop a design for the lab. Since implementing the hash table and the binary search tree, need a UML class for each one. Also include one for the simple structure (array that gets sorted). Include methods to help with the counting.
  - **Part 2, Implementation:** For this part implement structures and write up a comparison of the amount of work based on testing data.
